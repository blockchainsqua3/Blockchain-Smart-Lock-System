# Blockchain-Smart-Lock-System


##### Our project aims to develop an "Smart Lock System" based on blockchain with smart contract functionality. The decentralized and tamper-resistant nature of blockchain will bring about a more transparent housing information system. Each door lock device and its corresponding customer during the occupancy period will have their respective Ethereum addresses. When the door is unlocked, it will trigger a transaction, which will be recorded and stored on the blockchain. All nodes on the blockchain will synchronize and possess the record of this transaction. All unlocking records of the door will be available for viewing on a web page. This system utilizes decentralized data storage through blockchain technology, distinguishing it from traditional electronic lock database systems that rely on centralized storage. This approach ensures the preservation of complete records of door unlocking activities, mitigating risks such as data loss or tampering. It enhances customer trust and improves housing security.
